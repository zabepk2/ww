        </ul>
        <h3>For Biryani Layering</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>2 large onions, thinly sliced</li>
          <li>1/2 cup cooking oil or ghee</li>
          <li>2-3 green chilies, slit lengthwise</li>
          <li>1/2 cup fresh coriander leaves, chopped</li>
          <li>1/2 cup fresh mint leaves, chopped</li>
          <li>Saffron strands soaked in 2 tablespoons warm milk (for garnish)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Intructions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Marinate the Chicken:

In a mixing bowl, combine the yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, salt, lemon juice, and cooking oil.
Add the chicken pieces and coat them thoroughly with the marinade.
Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight for the best flavor.</li>
          <li>Prepare the Rice:

Wash the basmati rice thoroughly and soak it in water for about 30 minutes.
In a large pot, bring 4-5 cups of water to a boil. Add the soaked rice, green cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, and salt.
Cook the rice until it's about 70-80% cooked. The grains should still have a slight bite. Drain the rice and set it aside.</li>
          <li>Fry the Onions:

In a separate pan, heat the cooking oil or ghee over medium-high heat.
Add the sliced onions and fry them until they turn golden brown and crispy. Remove half of the fried onions for garnishing.</li>
         <li>Layering the Biryani:

In a heavy-bottomed pot or a biryani handi, add a layer of marinated chicken at the bottom.
Top it with a layer of partially cooked rice.
Sprinkle half of the fried onions, green chilies, fresh coriander, and mint leaves over the rice.
Repeat the layers with the remaining chicken, rice, and garnishes.
Drizzle the saffron milk over the top.</li>
          <li>Dum Cooking:

Cover the pot tightly with a lid or aluminum foil to seal in the steam.
Place the pot on very low heat or use a tava (griddle) underneath to create indirect heat.
Cook the biryani on dum for about 20-25 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together and the chicken to cook through.</li>
          <li>Serve:

Gently fluff the biryani with a fork before serving.
Garnish with the reserved fried onions.
Serve hot with raita or a side salad.
Enjoy your delicious homemade Pakistani Chicken Biryani!</li>
